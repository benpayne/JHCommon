/**
	Regex is a regular expression parsing class.  It takes a regular expression
	in the prepare method.  This method will build a tree representing the 
	RE.  You can call parse use the tree to match a string.  This means that
	you can prepare and RE and then us it many times.  Once parsed you can get
	at the string data captured by calling getData and getNumGroups will tell
	you how many groups have been found.  
	
	This class attempts to match Perl RE syntax.  Though not much testing has
	been done to ensure similar results.  RE process is faily complexe and 
	there is alot of "grey areas" if how data should be processed.  We've 
	errored on the side if simplicity.  So YMMV...
	
	If you looking for an easy way to parse some text, you might want to 
	consider rolling your own parse.  If you have complexe strings to parse
	then this class might be your choice.  Also keep in mind that how you write
	your RE will make a large difference in performance.
