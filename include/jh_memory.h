 *  	NULL to stop tracing.  The file will go in your
 *  	current working directory unless you give a full
 *  	path with the filename.  If you pass the same
 *  	filename twice, your call will be basically ignored,
 *  	but I will flush buffers and make sure all trace
 *  	data is written to disk.
 *
 *  	@param lfilename	filename of mTrace File
